            "I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing a headache.  I can't offer medical advice, so it's important to see a doctor if your headache is severe, sudden, or accompanied by other symptoms like fever, stiff neck, vision changes, numbness, or difficulty speaking.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general wellness tips that might help alleviate mild headaches:\n\n* **Hydration:** Dehydration can trigger headaches.  Try drinking a large glass of water.\n* **Rest:** Sometimes a headache is a sign your body needs rest. Try lying down in a quiet, dark room for a while.\n* **Over-the-counter pain relievers:**  Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be effective for some headaches.  Always follow the dosage instructions on the packaging.\n* **Cool compress:** Applying a cold pack or a damp cloth to your forehead or temples can sometimes provide relief.\n* **Warm compress:**  Alternatively, a warm compress or warm shower can help relax tense muscles.\n* **Caffeine:** A small amount of caffeine can sometimes help, but too much can make headaches worse.\n* **Gentle massage:**  Massaging your temples, neck, and shoulders can help relieve tension.\n* **Stress management:** Stress is a common headache trigger. Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation.\n* **Identify triggers:**  Keep a headache diary to track potential triggers like certain foods, lack of sleep, or specific activities. This can help you avoid them in the future.\n\nIf your headache persists or worsens, please consult a healthcare professional.  They can properly diagnose the cause of your headache and recommend the best course of treatment.  I hope you feel better soon!\n"

Since I'm not a medical professional, I can't give you medical advice, but I can reiterate the importance of seeing a doctor if your headache is severe, sudden, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like fever, stiff neck, vision changes, numbness, or difficulty speaking.\n\nWhile you're waiting to see a doctor, or if your headache is mild, here are a few things you could try:\n\n* **Hydrate:** Drink a glass of water now.
