            "Even a minor scratch from a rusty nail deserves attention because of the risk of tetanus.  While rust itself doesn't cause tetanus, rusty objects are often found in environments where tetanus bacteria thrive.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n1. **Wash the wound thoroughly:**  Use soap and clean, running water for at least five minutes. This helps remove dirt, debris, and some bacteria.\n2. **Stop the bleeding:** Apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or bandage.\n3. **Apply an antiseptic:** After cleaning, apply an over-the-counter antiseptic ointment or solution to help prevent infection.\n4. **Cover the wound:** Use a clean bandage to protect the scratch and keep it clean.\n5. **Monitor for infection:** Watch for signs of infection like increased pain, swelling, redness, pus, or fever.  If you notice any of these, seek medical attention promptly.\n\n**Regarding tetanus:**\n\n* **Check your tetanus vaccination status:** If you haven't had a tetanus booster in the last 5-10 years (or are unsure), it's crucial to contact a doctor or go to a clinic as soon as possible.  They can determine if you need a booster shot.\n* **If the wound is deep or dirty:** Even if your tetanus vaccinations are up-to-date, it's still a good idea to check with a healthcare professional, especially if the wound is deep, dirty, or continues to bleed.\n\nI can't offer medical advice, so seeing a doctor or other healthcare professional is always the best course of action for any injury.  They can properly assess the wound and provide the appropriate care.\n"

            "A scratch from a rusty nail, even a minor one, requires attention because of the risk of tetanus.  While I can't provide medical advice, here's what you should do:\n\n1. **Clean the wound thoroughly:** Wash the scratch with mild soap and warm water for at least five minutes.  This will help remove dirt, debris, and some bacteria.  You can also use an antiseptic solution if you have one.\n\n2. **Stop the bleeding:** Apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or bandage until the bleeding stops.\n\n3. **Assess the wound:**  How deep is it?  Is there any redness, swelling, or pus?  Does it feel hot to the touch?\n\n4. **Tetanus:** When was your last tetanus booster?  If it's been more than 5 years, or if you're unsure, you should see a doctor or go to an urgent care clinic as soon as possible.  Tetanus is a serious infection, and a booster shot is the best way to protect yourself.\n\n5. **Watch for infection:** Keep the wound clean and dry.  Cover it with a clean bandage.  Change the bandage daily.  Monitor the wound for signs of infection, such as increasing pain, redness, swelling, pus, or red streaks spreading from the wound.  If you notice any of these signs, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n6. **Seek medical advice:**  Even if the scratch seems minor, it's always a good idea to check with a doctor or other healthcare professional, especially if you have any concerns or if the wound doesn't seem to be healing properly.  They can assess the wound and recommend the best course of action.\n\n**Important:** I'm a health support and mental health support assistant, not a medical professional.
